Permutation tests and confidence sets
=====================================

``permute`` provides permutation tests and confidence sets for a variety of
nonparametric testing and estimation problems and for a variety of
randomization designs.

Benefits of Permutation Tests
-----------------------------

-  Gives a test with correct type 1 error rate, without needing
   uncheckable assumptions
-  We can get confidence intervals for the p-value -- this tells us how
   many iterations we need to achieve a certain precision
-  Choice of test statistic is flexible -- choose one that makes sense
   for your data, gives high power
