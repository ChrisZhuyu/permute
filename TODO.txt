1. NSGK results

- current tests has significant results and concordance is less than 1/2
- is there a test that reveals scientifically significant results
  as well as statistically significant

2. MacNell et al. re-analysis

- two-sample kind of thing.

3. Performance (Pythonic)

- numba / Cython ? (Stefan)

4. permuter scripts in pkg / building blocks

- Ultimately want scripts in permute to test.  Are vignettes reusable?
  - enumerate / (combinat from CSP.R)
  - itertools.combinations

4.5 exact two-sample problem

- (use MacNell as example/test)

from itertools import combinations

def two_sample

  reps == "exact" or 1, 2, ...

z = np.combinations([x, y])
if reps == "exact":
    for s in combinations(range(len(z)), len(x)):
        in = set(s)
        
         
- remove interval and level from two_sample signature (use outside function)



5. Confidence sets


- shift model

2-sample, ts is mean-like
 (want to estimate the difference in population means in this direction)

 a. estimate difference in means , s = xbar - ybar
 b. "know" ts(x-s, y) = 0 therefore the p-value is "big"
    x and y fixed, return p-value 


if 1/(n+m n) > alpha
  
sort z , x' = smallest len(x) of sorted x, y' remainder

s = x'bar - y'bar (worst case)

brentq(-b, s0, ...)

try with two-sample with exact

6. ecological fixed-margin tests
