1. NSGK results
- current tests has significant results and concordance is less than 1/2
- is there a test that reveals scientifically significant results
  as well as statistically significant

2. MacNell et al. re-analysis
- two-sample kind of thing.

3. Performance (Pythonic)
- numba / Cython ? (Stefan)

4. permuter scripts in pkg / building blocks
- Ultimately want scripts in permute to test.  Are vignettes reusable?
  - enumerate / (combinat from CSP.R)
  - itertools.combinations       
         
5. two_sample
- remove interval and level from two_sample signature (use outside function)
- exact two-sample problem
	- (use MacNell as example/test)
	- see issue + gist

6. Confidence sets
- shift model

2-sample, ts is mean-like
 (want to estimate the difference in population means in this direction)

 a. estimate difference in means , s = xbar - ybar
 b. "know" ts(x-s, y) = 0 therefore the p-value is "big"
    x and y fixed, return p-value 


if 1/(n+m n) > alpha
  
sort z , x' = smallest len(x) of sorted x, y' remainder

s = x'bar - y'bar (worst case)

brentq(-b, s0, ...)

try with two-sample with exact



7. k-sample tests
- ks-like test statistic: combine ks for each pair of samples by max distance, sum of distances, npc...
- Rank tests, e.g. Wilcoxon
- other?

8. n-dimensional k-sample
- MST
- LLQ
- MDL (research topic)

9. Association
- Pearson
- Spearman (replace data by their ranks in call to Pearson)
- Regression ( null beta=0)

10. Misc non-parametrics
- Runs tests
- Other kinds of symmetry
- Romano-style projection
- Permutation ANOVA

11. Contingency tables
- ecological fixed-margin tests 
	- Stefan's data example - see issue
	
12. Nonparametric combination of tests
